Next we need to ensure this code will be included in Captivate. We can do this by loading this code 'headlessly'. We use a similiar process to load the CpExtra library into Captivate. So follow the process explained in the video below. Just swap out the **Infosemantics_CpExtra.js** for **cc_edit.js**.

Your code should now be installed! Remember, you'll need to do this for **each** of your Captivate developers.
